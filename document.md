To develop an application for managing issues and tickets from the QC team, you can consider the following key features and suggestions:

1. **User Roles and Permissions**: Implement different user roles such as Admin, QA Lead, and Tester, each with specific permissions to view, create, update, and close tickets.

2. **Ticket Management**: Allow users to create new tickets, assign them to team members, set priority levels, add comments, and track the status of each ticket.

3. **Dashboard and Reporting**: Provide a dashboard with an overview of open tickets, resolved tickets, and other key metrics. Allow users to generate reports on ticket status, team performance, etc.

4. **Workflow Management**: Define custom workflows for different types of tickets (e.g., bug, task, improvement) with status transitions (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).

5. **Integration**: Integrate with version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN) and CI/CD tools to automatically create tickets for new issues or failed tests.

6. **Notifications**: Send email notifications for new tickets, status updates, and assignments to keep team members informed.

7. **Search and Filter**: Provide advanced search and filter options to quickly find specific tickets based on criteria such as status, assignee, priority, etc.

8. **Mobile Support**: Consider developing a mobile app or ensuring that the web application is responsive for use on mobile devices.

9. **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

10. **User Feedback**: Allow users to provide feedback on tickets and the overall application to continuously improve the system.

By incorporating these features and suggestions, you can create a comprehensive QC control center that meets the needs of your team and enhances your testing processes.

We've chosen Angular 15 with Angular Material for our project! Here's a general outline of steps you can follow to develop your QC Control Center application:

1. **Setup Angular Project**: 
   - Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
   - Create a new Angular project: `ng new qc-control-center`

2. **Install Angular Material**:
   - Install Angular Material and Angular CDK: `ng add @angular/material`
   - Choose a theme and set up global typography and animations in your styles.scss file

3. **Create Components**:
   - Create components for different parts of your application (e.g., dashboard, ticket list, ticket details, user management)

4. **Routing**:
   - Set up routing to navigate between different components

5. **Services**:
   - Create services to handle data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., fetching tickets from a backend API)

6. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using Angular services and guards

7. **Ticket Management**:
   - Create forms and components to manage tickets (e.g., create, update, assign)

8. **Dashboard**:
   - Design and implement a dashboard to display key metrics and summaries of ticket data

9. **Notifications**:
   - Implement notifications using Angular Material components or a library like ngx-toastr

10. **Testing and Deployment**:
    - Write unit tests for your components and services
    - Deploy your application to a hosting service (e.g., Firebase, Netlify, AWS)

11. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process

12. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Implement a feedback mechanism to gather input from users and improve the application over time

This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and design decisions.

## 1. User Roles and Permissions
Implementing user authentication in Angular involves using services to interact with your authentication backend and guards to protect routes that require authentication. Here's a basic example to get you started:

1. **Create an Authentication Service**:
   - Create a service to handle authentication logic (e.g., login, logout, check authentication status).
   - Use Angular's HttpClient to make HTTP requests to your authentication API.
   - authentication.service.ts
   
2. **Create an Auth Guard**:
   - Create a guard to protect routes that require authentication.
   - Use the authentication service to check if the user is authenticated.
   - auth.guard.ts

3. **Protect Routes**:
   - Use the Auth Guard to protect routes in your routing configuration.
   - app-routing.module.ts

4. **Use AuthenticationService in Components**:
   - Use the authentication service in your components to implement login and logout functionality.
   - login.component.ts

This is a basic example to get you started with user authentication in Angular. Depending on your application's requirements, you may need to add more features such as token expiration handling, role-based access control, and error handling.

To implement token expiration handling, role-based access control (RBAC), and error handling in your Angular application, you can build upon the basic authentication example provided earlier. Here's how you can enhance each of these aspects:

1. **Token Expiration Handling**:
   - Store the token expiration time in local storage along with the token.
   - Check the expiration time before making any authenticated API requests.
   - If the token is expired, redirect the user to the login page.
   - authentication.service.ts
   
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Define roles for users in your backend (e.g., Admin, QA Lead, Tester).
   - Store the user's role in local storage after successful login.
   - Use the role information to determine access permissions in your components and guards.
   - authentication.service.ts

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use Angular's error handling mechanisms (e.g., catchError) to handle errors from HTTP requests.
   - Display error messages to the user or log them for debugging purposes.
   - authentication.service.ts


By incorporating these enhancements, you can improve the security and functionality of your authentication system in Angular. Remember to adjust the implementation based on your specific requirements and backend API.
