It's great that you've chosen Angular 15 with Angular Material for your project! Here's a general outline of steps you can follow to develop your QC Control Center application:

1. **Setup Angular Project**: 
   - Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
   - Create a new Angular project: `ng new qc-control-center`

2. **Install Angular Material**:
   - Install Angular Material and Angular CDK: `ng add @angular/material`
   - Choose a theme and set up global typography and animations in your styles.scss file

3. **Create Components**:
   - Create components for different parts of your application (e.g., dashboard, ticket list, ticket details, user management)

4. **Routing**:
   - Set up routing to navigate between different components

5. **Services**:
   - Create services to handle data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., fetching tickets from a backend API)

6. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using Angular services and guards

7. **Ticket Management**:
   - Create forms and components to manage tickets (e.g., create, update, assign)

8. **Dashboard**:
   - Design and implement a dashboard to display key metrics and summaries of ticket data

9. **Notifications**:
   - Implement notifications using Angular Material components or a library like ngx-toastr

10. **Testing and Deployment**:
    - Write unit tests for your components and services
    - Deploy your application to a hosting service (e.g., Firebase, Netlify, AWS)

11. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process

12. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Implement a feedback mechanism to gather input from users and improve the application over time

This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and design decisions. Feel free to ask if you need more detailed guidance on any specific aspect of your application development!
